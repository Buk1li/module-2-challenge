# Challenge for Module 2 of the U of U bootcamp

This go around was different. It was my first time working without starter code, and honestly, I didnt realize how much effort it took to fully code a website, and Ive only made a single page!

I can't wait to see where the road leads from here, and I only hope I get more comofrtable as time goes on...
